The USA and USSR could not negotiate to unite them back

	- First was split into occupied zones
	- Later merged but couldn't agree to merge them back
		- West Germany
			- Capitalist
			- Democracy
		- East Germany
			- Communist 
			- Authitarian
	- Same was the fate to many countries after WW2
- Vietnam
- Korea
- China (Civil War)
