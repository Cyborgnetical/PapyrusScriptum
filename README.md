## About
ℹ️ This repo contains notes for all my classes currently in High School and Dual Enrollment. I made this repo to have a cloud backup of my obsidian notes. Im planning to use this Repo to sync my notes between devices and build a page for my website to easliy access them. If any of my teachers are watching and don't believe it was me whom made these notes, this is verification.
